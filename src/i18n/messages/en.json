    "items": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "Do I need a 4K monitor to use this?",
        "answer": "No! The Smart Resolution Detector generates custom resolutions (1080p, 2K, 4K) aligned to your screen's exact aspect ratio. Boosteroid renders at higher resolution, then downscales for sharper output even on a 1080p display."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What are the 6 Presets available?",
        "answer": "① OFF (disabled by default) ② Default (balanced) ③ Cinematic (max filters) ④ Competitive (minimal processing) ⑤ Comfort (eye-care) ⑥ Perfect Quality (4K + max enhancement). Filters are OFF by default - you choose which preset to activate!"
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Is this safe / will I get banned?",
        "answer": "This script only works client-side in your browser. It doesn't modify game files or Boosteroid servers. Zero risk of bans. Think of it like adjusting monitor settings or GPU driver sharpening."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Why does my FPS drop with filters enabled?",
        "answer": "Heavy filters (Clarity, Denoise, Deband) are GPU-intensive. Enable Performance Mode via Ctrl+Alt+P or dashboard. The script auto-adjusts filter intensity based on your device tier."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Which codec does the script use?",
        "answer": "Auto-selects the best codec your hardware supports: AV1 (best) > HEVC (great) > H.264 (fallback). This runs silently on first load. AV1 provides ~30% better quality at same bitrate."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How do I control the optimizer?",
        "answer": "A control panel appears on the Boosteroid dashboard with presets OFF by default. It's up to you to enable the toggles: Adaptive Quality, quick presets, and Performance Mode. Select your resolution and refresh the page to apply."
